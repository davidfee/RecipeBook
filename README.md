# RecipeBook

This project is used as a teaching resource within the BSc Hons. Advanced Topics in Computing module (UHI)

## Branch Structure

You can use this resource to view solutions to weekly exercises. Choose the branch corresponding to the week of teaching. Each branch contains the app in the state of end of the tutorials for any given week. For example, branch 1 has the app complete as of the end of the 1st week of tutorials (including the set exercise). 

## Re-building Dependencies

Run `npm install` to re-build the node_modules directory based on the package.json file. You will need to perform this prior to running the application in dev mode. However, if you simply want to reference the code, this isn't strictly necessary.
